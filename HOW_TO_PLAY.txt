Double click index.html and open it in any browser. You do not need internet.

Choose a letter (up to 4) to play with. Animals will just be the images in the /animals/ folder,
characters are just the images in the /characters/ folder. Words are the wordlists in the CUSTOM_WORDS.txt file.

Then choose today's images (up to 20). Press the checkmark in the top left corner.

Then pick the one image to use, and press GO.



For example, today you are doing letter B. 
 
    1. Press B on the keyboard, press the checkmark key.

    2. The words you want today are just "Ball, Bee, Balloon, Bear" and don't need the others.
        
        Select the 4 wanted words, and press the green checkmark in the top left corner.

    3. Ask a student (or two) to come up to the board. They can choose what they want to use.
    
        The student picks 'Balloon'

    4. Click the other 3 images, so only Balloon is visible.

    5. Press GO in the top left corner.

        The student will have 60 seconds to find all the Balloons. Clicking correct choices raises the combo score. 
    
    6. The score will be shown after 60 seconds. Press the OK button in the top left corner.

    7. Go back to step 3 for the rest of the students.
