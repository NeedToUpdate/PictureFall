If you wish to update images in the game, you must run the update_images.py file.

Add images to the images folder. You can either add them to the main folder, or add them to the specific letters.
For example, if you want the word 'Fox' to appear when you click 'X', make sure 'fox.png' is in the /x/ folder. 
Otherwise it will appear in the 'F' section since it starts with 'F'.

If you want to add a custom wordlist, like "tennis, gymnastics, volleyball, judo, pingpong, basketball", you can add the images to the folder,
then add the words into CUSTOM_WORDS.txt. Then when you run update_images.py, your wordlist will appear in the 'words' option in the game.

If this is the first time you use python, follow the following instructions:

ON WINDOWS:

1. Go to /Install Python/
2. Double click 'python windows.exe'. Install it.
4. Use the update_images.py file to update the images!

ON MAC:

1. Go to /Install Python/
2. Double click 'python mac.pkg'. Install it.
4. Double click the update_images.py file. It will open Idle
5. Click 'run' or F5
